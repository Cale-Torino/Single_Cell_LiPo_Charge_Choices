The TP4054 is a complete linear charger for single cell lithium-ion batteries.
Its SOT23-5 package and low external component count make the TP4054 ideally suited for portable applications.
Furthermore, the TP4054 can work within USB and wall adapter.
Thermal feedback regulates the charge current to limit the die temperature during high power operation or high ambient temperature. 
The charge voltage can be divided 4.2 V, and the charge current can be programmed externally with a single resistor. 
The TP4054 automatically terminates the charge cycle when the charge current drops to 1/10th the programmed value after the final float voltage reaching.
When the input supply (wall adapter or USB supply) is removed,
the TP4054 automatically enters a low current state, dropping the battery drain current to less than 2uA.
The TP4054 can be put into shut down mode, reducing the supply current to 45uA.
Other features include under voltage lockout, automatic recharge and one status pins to indicate charge termination.

Description
TP4059 is a complete single lithium ion battery charger,with battery positive and negative reverse connection protection reverse connection, with a larger 600mA charging current, more stable current consistency.
Its constant current/constant voltage linear control, SOT package and low number of external components make TP4059 an ideal choice for portable applications. TP4059 can be suitable for USB power and adapter power work.
External detection resistors and isolation diodes are not required due to the internal PMOSFET architecture and anti-reverse charging circuit.
Thermal feedback can automatically adjust the charging current to limit the chip temperature during high-power operation or high ambient temperature conditions.
The full voltage is fixed at 4.2V, while the charging current can be set externally via a resistor.
When the battery reaches 4.2V, the charging current drops to 1/10 of the set value, and the TP4059 will automatically stop charging.
When the input voltage (AC adapter or USB power supply) is removed, the TP4059 automatically enters a low current state with the battery leakage current below 2uA. Other features of the TP4059 include a charging current monitor, undervoltage latching, automatic recharging, and two status pins to indicate the end of charging and input voltage access
